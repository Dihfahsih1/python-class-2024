#what is git and the use of git in python
# Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software
#  development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes, revert to previous 
#  versions, and manage code efficiently. Git is widely used in the software development industry and is 
#  considered essential for modern software development workflows.

# Version Control:
#  Git tracks changes made to source code files, allowing developers to maintain a complete history of 
# revisions. This enables developers to revert to previous versions of the codebase if needed and compare 
# changes between different versions.

# Collaboration:
#  Git enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. Developers can create branches
#  to work on specific features or bug fixes independently, and later merge their changes back into the main 
# codebase using pull requests.

# Code Reviews:
#  Git facilitates code reviews by allowing developers to create pull requests (PRs) to propose changes to the
#  codebase. Other team members can review the changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements before the
#  changes are merged into the main codebase.

# Branching Strategies:
#  Git supports various branching strategies, such as feature branching, release branching, and git flow, 
# which help teams organize their development workflow and manage code releases effectively.

# Distributed Development: 
# Git is a distributed version control system, which means that each developer has a local copy of the entire
#  code repository. This enables developers to work offline, commit changes locally, and later synchronize 
# their changes with the central repository.

# Integration with CI/CD: 
# Git integrates seamlessly with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, allowing 
# automated testing, code quality checks, and deployment processes to be triggered based on code changes pushed
#  to the repository.
